# Flap Quest Game 🎮

Developed a 2D game where players control a bird navigating through obstacles, inspired by the Flappy Bird Game 🐦. This game features a bird that the player controls by pressing the **Enter** key to make it jump or move upwards. If the player does not press the key, the bird falls due to gravity, and the game ends when the bird hits the ground or a pipe. 🚧

## Game Features 🕹️
- **Bird Movement:** Press the **Enter** key to make the bird jump. Without user input, the bird falls automatically. 🐦⬆️
- **Pipes:** The game has alternating bottom and top pipes, and the objective is to pass through the openings. 🚪
- **Score System:** The player earns 1 point for successfully passing through each pipe opening. 🏅
- **Game Over:** The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground. The final score is displayed at the end of the game. 💥

## Libraries Used 📚
- **Java** (Swing and AWT for GUI)
- **javax.swing**
- **java.awt.***
- **java.awt.event.***
- **java.util.ArrayList**
- **java.util.Random**

## How to Play 🎮
1. Clone the repository and run the game from your Java IDE. 💻
2. Press **Enter** to make the bird jump and try to navigate it through the openings between the pipes. 🐦
3. Each successful pass through the pipes earns you 1 point. ✔️
4. If you collide with a pipe or the ground, the game will be over, and your score will be displayed. 🚧⚠️

## Setup 🔧
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. 🖥️
2. Import the project into an IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA. 🧑‍💻
3. Compile and run the `FlapQuest.java` file (or the main class). 🎮

## Future Improvements 🚀
- Add sound effects for jumping and collisions. 🔊
- Implement different difficulty levels with varying pipe speeds. 🏎️
- Add a menu screen with a start, pause, and reset option. 🎮
- Include animations for the bird and pipes. ✨
